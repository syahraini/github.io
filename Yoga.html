	<h1>Yoga</h1>
	<p><strong>Name Origin</p></strong>
	<p style="line-height:1.5">Yoga[a] (/ˈjoʊɡə/; Sanskrit: <i lang="hi">योग,</i> Sanskrit pronunciation: <i lang="hi">[joːɡɐ]</i>, lit. "yoke" or "union") is a <strong>group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines that originated in ancient India, aimed at controlling body and mind to attain various salvation goals</strong>, as practiced in the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions.</p>
	<p style="line-height:1.5">Yoga may have pre-Vedic origins, but is first attested in the early first millennium BCE. It developed as various traditions in the eastern Ganges basin drew from a common body of practices, including Vedic elements. Yoga-like practices are mentioned in the <i lang="hi"><a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regweda" target="_blank">Rigveda</i></a> and a number of early <i lang="hi">Upanishads</i>, but systematic yoga concepts emerge during the fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and <i lang="hi">Śramaṇa</i> movements, including Jainism and Buddhism. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the classical text on Hindu yoga, samkhya-based but influenced by Buddhism, dates to the early centuries of the Common Era. <em>Hatha yoga</em> texts began to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in <i lang="hi">Tantra</i>.</p>
	<p style="line-height:1.5">Yoga is practiced worldwide, but "yoga" in the Western world often entails a modern form of Hatha yoga and a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique, consisting largely of <i lang="hi">asanas</i>; this differs from traditional yoga, which focuses on meditation and release from worldly attachments. It was introduced by gurus from India after the success of <i lang="hi">Swami Vivekananda's</i> adaptation of yoga without <i lang="hi">asanas</i> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <i lang="hi">Vivekananda</i> introduced the Yoga Sutras to the West, and they became prominent after the 20th-century success of hatha yoga.
